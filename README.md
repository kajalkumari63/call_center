Create a dashboard in Power BI for Manager that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset.
The agent quadrant chart shows how many agents fall in a particular quadrant, and here we see that most fall in high calls and high duration.

The dashboard provides insights into the following:
1. Total calls, answered calls, abandoned calls, the average speed of answers, and customer satisfaction.
2. Average talk duration by agent and calls by topic.
3. Day, call speed of answer in seconds by an agent.
4. Matrix chart for each agent's performance quadrant.

The dashboard was created using Power BI, and it is designed to be easy to understand and use. The data is presented in a clear and concise way, and the charts and graphs are visually appealing. 

The dashboard is a valuable tool for call center managers, as it provides insights into the performance of their agents and the trends in call volume.
